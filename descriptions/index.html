        Cyclops are one of the beasts responsible for maintaining the connection between the <strong>creatures</strong> and the <strong>spirits.</strong> Being isolated primates, they have developed an extraordinary sense of communication with nature, instead of with themselves. They barely have any spoken language, although they are fluent in chanting spells to <em>awaken and influence</em> nature's spirits. A cyclop can have a lifespan of over 500 years, and an infant stage of over 30 years. Cyclops usually invest their knowledge and time into befriending specific <em>elemental spirits</em>, but some choose to master more than one kind of element.

The mushrooms may or may not be connected with their myscelium nets spiritually: it depends on their species. This means mushrooms can act either as a hive or as an organism. Mushrooms, hive-like or not, can act on both sides of the spectrum: in favor or against the balance of nature.</p>
