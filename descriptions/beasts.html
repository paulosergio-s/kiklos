                Cyclops are one of the beasts responsible for maintaining the connection between the
                <strong>creatures</strong>
                and the <strong>spirits.</strong> Being isolated primates, they have developed an extraordinary sense of
                communication with nature, instead of with themselves. They barely have any spoken language, although
                they
                are
                fluent in chanting spells to <em>awaken and influence</em> nature's spirits. A cyclop can have a
                lifespan of
                over 500 years, and an infant stage of over 30 years. Cyclops usually invest their knowledge and time
                into
                befriending specific <em>elemental spirits</em>, but some choose to master more than one kind of
                element.

                A sunfox is a fire-breathing predator native to the Vermillion Plains. Usually has yellow fur, and a
                small
                size.
                They typically prey on crane-eggs.

                or
                may not be connected with their myscelium nets spiritually: it depends on their species. This means
                mushrooms
                can act either as a hive or as an organism. Mushrooms, hive-like or not, can act on both sides of the
                spectrum:
                in favor or against the balance of nature.</p>
