            Completely loyal spirits, they are capable of giving you shelter, food, and/or safety for their animal

        <h4 id='feline'>Felines</h4>
        <p lang='en-us'>Feline spirits are one of the most active elemental earth spirits. They will provide you shelter
            and
            defense force. Once a feline spirit befriends a mortal, he will be loyal to that bloodline for as long as
            the
            animal proves himself as an allie of the Earth.
