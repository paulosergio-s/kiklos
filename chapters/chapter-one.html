    <h1 id='Chapter One'>Chapter 1</h1>
    <p lang="en-us">Lotta, the cyclop, is following her spiritual instincts. She senses something
        unstabilizing the balance of the environment. <br>Her son closely follows her.<br> Kiklos, a 30 year old
        cyclop, still has the shape and mind of a toddler. As they reach The Vermillion Plains, Lotta decides to set
        up camp. It would have been a beautiful sight, if it weren't pitch
        black dark. Kiklos watches her as she takes a book out of her brown leather bag, and reads out a language that
        is strange to her son. The earth rumbles, ever so slightly, almost sounding like a <ins>soft purr.</ins> Suddenly, their old
        companion, a feline earth spirit,is summoned and opens her mouth. They walk in to find a warm, dark cave. </p>
    <hr>
    <p lang="en-us">Kiklos wakes up to the sunlight, coming in through the cave's mouth. He notices his mom's bookbag,
        but no sign of her. He leaves it behind with his friend and walks out of the cat-cave. She descends back into
        the depths of the earth with a concerning growl. The youngster observes, for a minute, the majestic Plains. Red
        grass grew vigorously everywhere he looked. Long-neck Cranes were flying around, as he had seen countless times,
        looking for any <em>potential danger</em> to protect their nests from. <em>Danger</em> as in sunfoxes. Small, stealthy,
        firebreathing predators that love nutritious crane eggs.</p>
    <p lang="en-us"><em>The boy hears some rustling</em>, and out of the tall grass, walks out a <strong>yellow
        fox</strong>. Almost half his own size, Kiklos is not startled, until he notices a blue mushroom growing
        from the top of the sunfox's head. Mushrooms are extremely intelligent creatures, and some can be dangerous. The two
        stared for two whole minutes, analyzing each other. For the mushroom, a child cyclop without his
        mother was <em>the</em> rarest of sights. It was mesmerized. The sunfox walks away, the same way he came from. A soothing
        and soft rumble could now be felt at Kiklos feet, and he heard the words: "<em>Go after him.</em>"</p>
