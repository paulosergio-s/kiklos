    <h1>SPIRITS</h1>
    <p class="pb">Spirits are the breathing personalities of the forces of nature. If everything is balanced, the spirits peacefully keep to themselves. If not, they can become stirred, annoyed, awoken and out of balance. That can represent advantage to some, but it will represent destruction to most.</p>

<p class="pb">The cat spirits of rock are loyal to the bloodlines of balanced beings, up until the point they stop contributing to the earth. They can provide the allies of the spirits with shelter, safekeeping, defense, and in emergencies, with travel. Feline earth spirits are an extremely rare sight, and an extremely powerful allie.</p>
