    <h3>CYCLOP</h3>
    <p class="pb">The rarest and strongest of the primates. They have a deeper connection with the spirits than they do with any other beings, and have a deep respect for the delicate balance of nature. The only contact they have with other cyclops is for reproduction: and even then, the mother stays raising the child by herself for another 45 years, whenever it is finally ready to look after itself and its own areas. The lifespan of an average cyclop is around 900 years old. In all this lifetime, they are able to learn to <em>speak</em> with nature itself; and <strong>work</strong> with its powers and influences. </p>

    <h3>SUNFOX</h3>
    <p class="pb">
      Very common animal in the Vermillion Plains. It is very small, and has yellow, shiny fur. Do not underestimate them because of their size, for they are very fearless predators due to thir unique abiity: <strong>fire-breathing</strong>. The only thing it fears is the gaze of an adult <em>Long-neck Crane</em>.
    </p>
    <h3>LONG-NECK CRANE</h3>
    <p class="pb">Large birds with a wingspan of over 2 meters, and a full height of 4 meters. Its retractable neck helps with the balancing of such extreme measures; All necessary to protect their nests from sneaky <em>sunfoxes.</em> </p>
    <h3>MUSHROOMS</h3>
    <p class="pb">Mushrooms are an extremely diverse separate world of species and beasts. They could be anywhere from a hive minded monster; to an independant being doing its share to keep the balance. They could have endless possibilities of skills, when you take into account the immense genetic pool they keep drawing from. We have already succesfully docummented mushrooms from this world <em>bending clouds, controlling minds, and connecting to thousands of other hives</em> in nothing more than a quick instant, by touching any nest of myscelia hanging around. It is rumored that they are expanding their mutualism to more trees everyday, as well, deepening their M-NET connections and also providing more genetic advantages. </p>
    <h4>M-NET</h4>
    <p class="pb">The myscelium net that connects <em>90% of rooted beings</em> on most major biomes, constantly exchanging information between plants, fungi, and even some species of insects. <br><strong>M-NET STILL HAS LARGELY UNKNOWN AND UNSTUDIED POTENTIAL!</strong></p>
    <h4>
      BLUE MUSHROOMS
    </h4>
    <p class="pb"> 
      Blue mushrooms are benevolent and intelligent mushrooms. Acting as a hive when close-by, mushrooms will often go 'rogue' or 'independant' when they, respectively, go on missions either personal or for the hive. They can also, as most mushrooms can, connect to the M-NET.
