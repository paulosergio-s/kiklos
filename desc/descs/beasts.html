    <figcaption>Cyclop using water-magic.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p class="pb">The rarest and strongest of the primates. They have a deeper connection with the spirits than they do
    with any other beings, and have a deep respect for the delicate balance of nature. The only contact they have with
    other cyclops is for reproduction: and even then, the mother stays raising the child by herself for another 45
    years, whenever it is finally ready to look after itself and its own areas. The lifespan of an average cyclop is
    around 900 years old. In all this lifetime, they are able to learn to <em>speak</em> with nature itself; and
    <strong>work</strong> with its powers and influences. </p>

  <p class="pb">
    Very common animal in the Vermillion Plains. It is very small, and has yellow, shiny fur. Do not underestimate them
    because of their size, for they are very fearless predators due to thir unique abiity:
    <strong>fire-breathing</strong>. The only thing it fears is the gaze of an adult <em>Long-neck Crane</em>.

  </figure>
 
  <p class="pb" id='pe'>Mushrooms are an extremely diverse separate world of species and beasts. They could be anywhere from a
    hive minded monster; to an independant being doing its share to keep the balance. They could have endless
    possibilities of skills, when you take into account the immense genetic pool they keep drawing from. All shrooms have the ability to connect to the M-NET, and also have high engaging in Mutualism.</p>
  <h4>M-NET</h4>
  <p class="pb">The myscelium net that connects <em>90% of rooted beings</em> on most major biomes, constantly
    exchanging information between plants, fungi, and even some species of insects. <br><strong>M-NET STILL HAS LARGELY
      UNKNOWN AND UNSTUDIED POTENTIAL!</strong></p>

      BLUE MUSHROOMS
    </h4>
    <img class="out" src="../../images/blue-mushroom.jpg" alt="Rogue blue mushrroom Monk bending clouds.">
  </figure>
  <p class="pb">
    Blue mushrooms are benevolent and intelligent mushrooms. Acting as a hive when close-by, mushrooms will often go
    'rogue' or 'independant' when they, respectively, go on missions either personal or for the hive. They can also, as
    most mushrooms can, connect to the M-NET.
